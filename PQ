Hi Lindsay

I can see the value in adding peak positions to previous months and I’ll work that in.

For the Peak Position page, the issue comes from cases where a bank records the same NSC usage more than once in a month, such as Access Bank in August 2025. I’ll adjust the sorting so it still works as expected.

From the D&A design review, there was also a suggestion to include visuals that help spot trends. If that’s of interest, it would be helpful to know the business questions you’d want those visuals to answer.

Happy to proceed once I hear from you.
