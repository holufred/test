Subject: Update on Corporate Governance KPI Dashboard Actions

Hi Aaron,

Apologies for the delay in progressing this. I’ve implemented some of the agreed actions and will complete the remainder by COB today.

The next step will be to set up a SharePoint site as we discussed. Once that is in place, I will prepare the architecture and take it through the internal D&A design review session for governance and wider team visibility (currently planned for 5 November). I’ll update you once it is published.

For awareness, I will be away from 6 October and returning on 20 October.

Best regards,
Key

Would you like me to make the “apology” line softer (e.g., “Thank you for your patience as I’ve been progressing this” instead of “Apologies for the delay”)?
