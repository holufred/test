Here’s a concise and clear draft for your managers:

Subject: Systemic Risk Update

Hi All,

I’ve brought in the actual FPS data and compared it against the forecast, but the comparison isn’t fully valid as the forecast is based on cycle data while the actuals are traffic data. Ops are not fully confident and have reached out to HSBC to obtain their forecast data for a direct comparison with our predictions. For BACS and IPS, Ops have also asked for a variance check if we hold cycle data at the same granularity as the forecast. We don’t currently have that level of granularity.

On the New Daily FPS Peak dashboard, I’ll present the high-level view at tomorrow’s design review session, after which I’ll begin development.

Best regards,
Kayode

Do you want me to make the tone a bit more solution-oriented (e.g. suggesting next steps), or keep it purely informational?
