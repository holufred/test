Dear all,

I wanted to flag that we may not be able to meet the deadline for the January Cap Management packs due tomorrow, 12 February.

In previous years, an annual review was carried out to set the benchmark date. As this did not take place in 2025, the packs have picked December 2025 rather than December 2024, which was the last review point. The Data Engineering team is working on resolving this, and I’ll keep you updated on progress and revised timings.

Kind regards,
Kayode
