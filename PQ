Understood — here’s a more diplomatic rewrite that avoids saying the existing semantic models are “not suitable” but still explains why they won’t work for this case:

Subject: Update on Design Review Preparation

Hi all,

As suggested, I’ve explored the data options for the new reports. The existing semantic models are very useful for other reporting needs, but in this case they don’t provide the required level of granularity or the amount of historical data we need. Using models at a lower granularity would also place the performance load on Power BI rather than the database, which could affect efficiency.

I’ve discussed this with Glen and identified an approach to pull the data with the necessary historical context and granularity into a new Dataflow. This Dataflow could then feed a dedicated semantic model for the reports if approved.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to make the last line a bit stronger, e.g. “I’ll wait for your approval before proceeding”, so they know you’re explicitly holding off?
