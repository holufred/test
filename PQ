Perfect, this helps a lot. I’ll keep this practical, senior-level, and measurable, and avoid overlap between objectives.
Here’s a clean version with 4 objectives and 2 targets each, with clear separation between reporting, systems/resilience, insight, and personal development.
Objective 1: Strengthen BAU reporting and reporting governance
Focus: Reliability, clarity, and control of reporting.
Targets:
Consolidate the reporting inventory into a single, maintained source of truth and deliver a dashboard that shows coverage, ownership, refresh status, and key dependencies.
Reduce recurring BAU reporting issues by introducing at least 3 standardised QA or validation checks across priority reports or datasets.
Objective 2: Improve system resilience and enable self-service analytics
Focus: Stability, performance, and reducing pressure on core systems.
Targets:
Deliver at least 2 dashboards that enable the business to perform self-service analysis and basic data quality or operational checks without analyst intervention.
Migrate or refactor at least 1 high-usage dataset or report to a more robust and efficient data flow or model, reducing refresh time, query load, or operational risk.
Objective 3: Increase business insight and decision support
Focus: Moving from reporting to insight and action.
Targets:
Deliver at least 1 new insight-led dashboard or analytical product that helps the business understand performance, risk, or trends and supports decision-making.
Lead or co-lead at least 2 pieces of analysis that result in a clear recommendation, action, or change in process agreed with stakeholders.
Objective 4: Personal and professional development
Focus: Skills, visibility, and bringing value back to the team.
Targets:
Make measurable progress toward the CDMP certification (or complete it, depending on timeframe), with agreed milestones.
Attend at least 2 data events, meetups, or hackathons and share key learnings with the team or apply at least one idea in day-to-day work.
If you want, I can:
Tune this to your company’s performance template language, or
Make it slightly more conservative or more ambitious depending on how strict scoring usually is where you work.
