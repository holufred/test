Subject: IMD Meeting Update and Forecasting Context

Hi Monsur,

I had a brief IMD session with the Ops team earlier. One of their requests is to include an Actuals Comparison page (via a bookmark) to show daily variances between forecast and actuals.

They also noted that the widest variances occur on the first and last working days of each month and asked why the forecast doesn’t account for these patterns, even after I clarified that it’s based on a top-down approach.

I’ve scheduled next Wednesday for a high-level design walkthrough of the proposed comparison page. Please let me know your availability before then so I can get more context on the forecasting methodology.

Best,
Kayode

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter or keep this level of detail?
