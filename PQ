Hi John,

To clarify the current operating model, the Data function is now split between D&AI and Data Engineering, with clear ownership boundaries. D&AI focuses on analytics, reporting, and data consumption, while Data Engineering owns data ingestion, pipelines, refresh processes, and technical remediation.

Based on this structure, and in alignment with the self-serve model being adopted by the business, I have summarised ownership and next steps below.

Item| Description| Primary Ownership| Notes / Next Steps
CASS MCA 1149| Monthly data download used for regulatory reporting| Data Engineering| This is a data extraction and ingestion process. Ownership therefore sits with Data Engineering rather than D&AI. Any issues relating to refresh, automation, or data availability should be progressed with Engineering.
CISA Monthly Volumetric & Compliance Reports| Monthly reports generated from a master spreadsheet| Product (master file) / Data Engineering (technical issues)| In line with the self-serve model, ownership of the master file that generates the reports should sit with the Product team. Any technical or data issues would be resolved with Data Engineering. D&AI can support the reporting layer once data is available in a stable form.
SSCC Monthly Dashboard| Power BI dashboard sourced from upstream data| Data Engineering (pipelines) / D&AI (reporting layer)| The dashboard includes upstream engineering components. D&AI can maintain the Power BI report, while data refresh and pipeline dependencies remain with Data Engineering.
Engineering Capacity| Current delivery constraints| —| As noted previously, the Engineering team has been impacted by capacity constraints and will pick these up once capacity allows.

Happy to discuss further if useful.

Kind regards,
Kayode
