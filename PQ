Here’s a concise draft you can use with Steven (keeping it clear, polite, and precise so he focuses only on what you’re asking, while being manager-appropriate for CC):

Subject: Data for Bi-Directional Forecast vs Actuals

Hi Steven,

Thanks for pointing me to the right tables. I need your guidance on which columns to use for extracting the required volumes, as there are a few options and I want to be sure I’m aligning with the right ones.

For clarity, I’d like to display the comparison on this dashboard [link], where the requirement is to compare the bi-directional forecast against the actuals.

Also, one of the points raised at the design review was to ensure all joins to reference data are based on IDs rather than names. Would it be possible to retrofit the GPS, BACS, and ICS tables in the forecasting dataset with participant IDs, so we keep things consistent and scalable?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to make the ask about “retrofit” sound more like a request for feasibility (e.g. “can you confirm if this can be done”) rather than a direct instruction? That might sit better if you’re CC’ing your manager.
