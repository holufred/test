Ah right — good catch. Power BI tooltips in info icons don’t allow bullets, line breaks are better. Here’s a Power BI–ready version that stays concise and readable when someone hovers:


---

Peak Position info text

Peak Position shows the largest net position reached in a day.
Negative means net debit (sent more than received).
Positive means net credit (received more than sent).
The most negative point is used to calculate NSC usage.


---

NSC Usage (%) info text

NSC Usage is the ratio of a participant’s peak debit position to their Net Sender Cap.
Debit peaks are shown as positive usage values.
Higher percentage means closer to the cap.
Colour coding: Green less than 70 percent, Amber 70 to 85 percent, Red greater than 85 percent.
NSC usage greater than 90 percent is auto flagged as a potential liquidity concern.

Would you like me to also make a shorter “one-liner” version of each (for when space is very tight), or keep this slightly more descriptive style?
